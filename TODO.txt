Enable SVCs calling other SVCs - Store CPSR
        This would enable much nicer keypad handling, rather than having 2 SVC calls in the interrupt.
Move SVCs to jump table.
Figure out some way of handling interrupts in user mode.
Convert CMPs to TSTs, where applicable - mostly in SVCs.
Move LCD svs register definitions into method descriptions.







PWM generator
        input value n

generator has a counter, c, which repeatedly goes from 0-m at clock speed.
if c > n, output = 1
else output = 0





ledVal = 0;

user_program
        get button input
        if # is down
                ledVal++;
                svc call to set PWM value in hardware



        interrupt
                get pwm value from hardware
                set pwm value to LED


reg select must be high, and not write (NWR) must be low in order for anything to go to the latch.
if the mux is high (a0), it outputs the threshold that we inputted, otherwise it outputs the generated PWM.



20000003 = threshold
20000002 = PWM out.
